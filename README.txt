I developed this Visual Studio C# console application project for C# programming language course. The objective given by the teacher was to build a multimedia library application similiar to the first project developed as a console application but using Windows webforms this time. I also added by myself serialization for saving data to a file instead of just plain text.

This version 1.0 (Original Project) is created under Portuguese language for the interface, variables and comments. Sorry about that, but if you run the application you should be able to understand well what it does.

Feel free to use or make any changes to it.
